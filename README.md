ABSTRACT:
Water pollution is one of the biggest threats to our surroundings. To supply good
quality of water it is important to monitor the quality of water. So, we are designing a
cheap and time-saving water pollution monitoring system. The system comprises of
different sensors which is used to measure the physical and chemical parameters of the
water. The parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, TDS sensor of the water can
be measured. The measured values from the sensors are provided to Arduino, it reads
the data and provide the results. Finally, the sensor data gets appended in the file and
can also be viewed on Arduino serial monitor.

Key Wordsâ€” pH sensor, Turbidity sensor, TDS sensor, Arduino model

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The quality of drinking water plays a crucial role in the health of animals and
human beings. Lakes and reservoirs, canals one of the major sources of
drinking water. Water quality monitoring of these water bodies requires a lot of
effort as operators need to get in a boat with all sensors and manually check
the entire water body. The current manual method for monitoring of the water
quality requires Money, Time consuming and labor intensive. So, we are
designing a solution for easy water quality checking of vast water bodies with
ease.

#### PROJECT BACKGROUND

<p>The water quality monitoring is very important now a days. As there are various
resources available but still no progress. In most cases the water gets contaminated
due to different reasons and one of the major reason is industrial waste. This needs
to be stopped somewhere.
Conventional water quality checking methods include sampling and laboratory
techniques. These strategies are however not cost effective and time consuming
which eventually leads to delayed in detection of impurities and reaction to those
contaminants in water. So, there should be more efficient and productive checking
strategies to monitor the quality of water.
 To cure this real time monitoring of water quality should be done. So, the RC boat
is used for continuously moving on water surface to identify water quality. The
different sensors are interfaced to the controller viz. water temperature sensor, air
temperature & humidity sensor, Ph sensor, Turbidity sensor.</p>
